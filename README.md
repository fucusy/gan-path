# gan-path

## Purpose

Learning various generative adversarial network by **pratice** of writing
code based on Torch/Lua.

## Dependency

* [Torch 7](https://github.com/torch/torch7), deep learning framework based on 
Lua language
* [iTorch](https://github.com/facebookarchive/iTorch), iTorch is an IPython 
Kernel for Torch, you can write torch code in an interactive mode.


## GANs

GAN timeline from [here](https://github.com/dongb5/GAN-Timeline)

### GAN introducted by Ian Goodfellow at NIPS 2014, "Generative Adversarial Networks"

code is located at dirtory `gan`,  find [Train.ipynb](https://github.com/fucusy/gan-path/blob/master/conditional_gan/Train.ipynb)
, run it in IPython with
iTorch.

### GAN with condition by Mehdi Mirza at arXiv 2014, "Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets" 

code is located at dirtory `conditional_gan`, find [Train.ipynb](https://github.com/fucusy/gan-path/blob/master/gan/Train.ipynb), run it in 
IPython with iTorch.


### GAN with deep convolutional network from Radford, Alec at arXiv 2015, "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" 

code is located at dirtory `deep_convolutional_gan`
